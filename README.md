# Date Range Picker with keyboard navigation

Merely attempting to add keyboard date selection to [Daterangepicker](https://github.com/dangrossman/daterangepicker) by pulling in changes from [PR 1577](https://github.com/dangrossman/daterangepicker/pull/1577/) on that project.

Tested manually on latest stable Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on OSX Mojave (12/26/2018).

Needs testing on Windows; iOS; Android; etc
